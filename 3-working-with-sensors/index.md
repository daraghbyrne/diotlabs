title: "3. Working with sensors"
---

We've figured out our Particle board and worked with some basic outputs (LEDs), now it's time to turn our attention to sensors. 

Sensors allow us to convert environmental considitions to electicity which our Particle board. They let us know the world around our board - reading light levels, noise, temperature and even gas particles in the air! 

In this section, we're going to exlore how to get useful information from the world around our board through this wonderful things!

### Components you will need

* Particle Microcontroller 

* [Breadboard]({{site.baseurl}}/breadboards)

* [Jumper Wires]({{site.baseurl}}/1-a-simple-internet-appliance/jumpers)

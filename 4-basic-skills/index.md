In this section, we'll look at some important practical skills for working with circuits and electronics. Soldering lets you permanently connect electronic components, wires and breadboards together to form stable circuits. This is really useful when 
1. when you order a component and the headers aren't attached yet,
2. when you want to build more complicated circuits, 
3. when you want to extend the reach of a component i.e. adding a length of wire to the terminals on a sensor so you can move it further away and
4. when you want to put your circuits in a housing or small enclosure. 

### Components you will need

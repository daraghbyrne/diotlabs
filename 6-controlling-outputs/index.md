title: "6. Controlling Outputs"
---

In this section, we'll look at a bunch of ways to control, adjust and adapt outputs from your microcontroller. We've already looked at one type of outcome, visible light produced with LED's, in section 1 and 2. Now, we'll look at motors and actuators which convert electrical energy into movement or motion.

Motion is just one type of output. There's also creating sound/noise from a speaker or piezos! We'll cover this too. You can also use pumps to inflate or deflate pressure vessels (balloons), using fans to blow air, creating heat or cooling stuff down, and lots more!

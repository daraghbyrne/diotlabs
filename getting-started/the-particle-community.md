title: "Look to the Particle Community"
---

The Particle team have helped grow an incredible community. They have [detailed guides](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/) and [programming references](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/) on the Particle and their previous microcontroller, the Core.  There's tonnes of resources for you online and lots of people who are actively [sharing their projects and prototypes](https://particle.hackster.io) online as well as helping others through the [community forums](https://community.particle.io). 

If you have questions or you want to do something that isn't covered in these sets of tutorials, e.g. using a more complicated component, that's the place to look!

Resistors are in nearly every circuit. They help to regulate the flow of electricity to our components and can protect sensitive components too. 

They do what their name suggests: they resist the flow of electricity. Each resistor does this to a specific amount, known as their resistance.  This is measured in Ohms (denoted as Ω) and is based on Ohm’s law (see [What is Electricity](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6TEooUr0_sSd2FNMVQ3eFFpVGM/view?usp=sharing)). 

# Prototyping with Resistors

While in normal circuits, you’ll want to use resistors more precisely; when prototyping we really only need two resistors: 1KΩ and a 10KΩ.  The 1KΩ resistor is normally placed before components like LEDs to protect them while the 10KΩ resistor is used to impede the flow of electricity but create a complete when working with switches and other input devices. More on that later…

# Knowing which resistor is which

All resistors are color coded. The have four bands which you can use to tell you how much resistance they have

{% include figure.html src="../images/image08.jpg" caption="Resistor Color Codes - an essential reference" class="" %}

The first two bands tells you the most important digits of the resistors value. The third band is a multiplier or a weight, which multiplies the previous two digits by a power of ten. The final band is the tolerance of the resistor or the degree of accuracy in its resistance. A 1% tolerance means it could be -1% or +1% of the amount specified.

**Confused?** Don’t be. You don’t really need to know how to look up resistance for two reasons:

1. You can use a calculator like this one to find out the resistance based on the band colors: [http://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band](http://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band)

1. Or, I can just tell you the color codes of the two resistors you’ll use most often:

    1. **1K****Ω:  **BROWN, BLACK, **RED**, [GOLD]

    2. **10****K****Ω:** BROWN, BLACK, **ORANGE**, [GOLD]

# Using a resistor

Every resistor has two terminals (or wires). It doesn’t matter which direction, order, orientation, etc you put these wires in, it will work either way!

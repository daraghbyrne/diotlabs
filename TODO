hm, I used A0?  but on the new chips, the 3V3* pin doesn’t exist, you have to use the regular 3V3

A write up on libraries and their role 

Transistor demo 
	- using actuators, fans, etc. 
	- driving LED strips
	- e.g. a scent dispersal unit
		( actuator to pop lid or agitate, LED strips to show activity inside, fan to blow, maybe a gas sensor )

Add vibration motor exmaple 


http://diotlabs.daraghbyrne.me/5-getting-input/buttons/ - Wiring to ground box - The link explains pull Up/Down resistors, but it might be good to just mention that internal pull ups are just resistors on the photon (internal pull ups confused me for the longest time when I was learning this stuff in high school because they made me question when I needed an external pull up and when I didn’t). We can also explain the code change that enables the internal pull up as well.

“Step 3: Open Particle Dev” not working box - 
should we add info about installing dfu-util?

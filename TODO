ADD PIR Example to Sensors
Add a Wirestripping section to basic skills

FYI, in the Lab 2: RGB LEDs there is an error in the schematic/code. The A0 pin assigned for the Red LED pin is not a PWM pin and will not work for analogWrite(). Use D2 instead and it works fine.

hm, I used A0?  but on the new chips, the 3V3* pin doesnâ€™t exist, you have to use the regular 3V3

Transistor demo 
	- using actuators, fans, etc. 
	- driving LED strips
	- e.g. a scent dispersal unit
		( actuator to pop lid or agitate, LED strips to show activity inside, fan to blow, maybe a gas sensor )

ADD PIR Example to Sensors
Add a Wirestripping section to basic skills


FYI, in the Lab 2: RGB LEDs there is an error in the schematic/code. The A0 pin assigned for the Red LED pin is not a PWM pin and will not work for analogWrite(). Use D2 instead and it works fine.

hm, I used A0?  but on the new chips, the 3V3* pin doesnâ€™t exist, you have to use the regular 3V3
